      <p>Are there fees for your services? Do you take insurance?</p>
      <p>
        Yes there is a charge. Unfortunately, end-of-life doula services are not
        converd by Medicare or other insurance. Instead, such services, like
        other companion/caregiver type services are typically paid for by
        individuals and families as an out-of-pocket private expense. There are
        discounts available if you choose multiple services. Payment plans are
        available as well. I can work with all budgets. Please contact me today
        to schedule a free consultation.
