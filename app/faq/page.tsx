      <p>Are there fees for your services? Do you take insurance?</p>
      <p>
        Yes there is a charge. Unfortunately, end-of-life doula services are not
        converd by Medicare or other insurance. Instead, such services, like
        other companion/caregiver type services are typically paid for by
        individuals and families as an out-of-pocket private expense. There are
        discounts available if you choose multiple services. Payment plans are
        available as well. I can work with all budgets. Please contact me today
        to schedule a free consultation.

        What is the difference between a hospice volunteer and an end-of-life
        doula?
      </p>
      <p>
        The death doula's service do not take the place of hospice personnel;
        rather they complement other services that a dying person and their
        family may be receiving buy providing additional support and community
        resources for end of life care for the patient and their families. There
        are laws governing what death doulas can and cannot do. <br />
        Hospice volunteers are mandated by Medicare law and the hospice care
        providers' hours are regulated by Medicare. Medicare law requiers that
        volunteer hours equal at least five percent of the hospice provider's
        total patient care hours.
